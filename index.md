Welcome!

I'm a bachelorâ€™s student in Video Game Design and Development at the [CITM], [UPC]. Through my work, I've discovered the applications of Easings and Splines in videogames, and how using these can help create smooth animations and transitions, enhancing the user experience and making digital graphics more engaging.

On this website, I'll be sharing my findings on the topic, explaining the C++ libraries I've developed. These libraries are designed to be efficient and easy to use, even for beginners.

In addition, I have also provided educational resources, including code examples and tutorials, to help others learn to implement them in their own projects.

I believe in open collaboration and welcome feedback and contributions from others interested in this field. If you have any questions, comments, or ideas, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for reading, and I hope you find my work informative and helpful.
