# About Easings

The concept of easing was first introduced in the 1930s by Disney animators, who were looking for ways to make their animated characters move more fluidly. However, it wasn't until the rise of computer graphics in the 1980s that easings became a common technique in animation software.

Easing techniques are used in a wide variety of applications, and have a significant impact on the gameplay experience in video games, especially in games that require precision control and quick reflexes. One of the most common applications of easing in video games is to create smooth movement animations for characters, objects and the camera.

For example, when a character jumps, easing can be used to make the jump animation appear more natural by gradually accelerating the character's movement upward and then gradually slowing down their descent. It can also be used to create more responsive controls and to smooth camera transitions between different game areas or angles.
