# Improvements
I found the topic of Splines so interesting that I ended up inmersing myself in an exhaustive research. Having deviated from the main topic, I run out of time and wasn't able to implement everything I had planed.

Here are some of them:
- Saving/loading spline points with .xml after editing the spline.
- Velocity along the spline must be constant.
- Add moving NPC to SceneSplines
